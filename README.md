oceanFFT
=======

This is a simulation of an ocean done entirely on the CPU using the FFTW library,
using the equations defined in the [Tessendorf paper](http://graphics.ucsd.edu/courses/rendering/2005/jdewall/tessendorf.pdf).

Lighting is currently broken, surface normals are copied to the graphics card in the incorrect order.
