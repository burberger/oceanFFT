oceanFFT
=======

This is a simulation of an ocean done entirely on the CPU using the FFTW library,
using the equations defined in the [Tessendorf paper](http://graphics.ucsd.edu/courses/rendering/2005/jdewall/tessendorf.pdf).

Inspiration for this project came from http://www.keithlantz.net/2011/11/ocean-simulation-part-two-using-the-fast-fourier-transform/
and uses code from his examples.

Lighting is currently broken, surface normals aren't in the right places (I think).
